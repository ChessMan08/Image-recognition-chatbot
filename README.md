# Advanced Image Recognition Chatbot

## Overview

This project features an advanced image recognition chatbot designed to identify objects within images and provide accurate, context-based responses to user queries. The chatbot integrates technologies like Vision Transformer (ViT) for image recognition and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enable seamless, human-like interactions.

## Features

- **Image Recognition**: Utilizes Vision Transformer (ViT) for high-accuracy object identification within images.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Integrated NLP enables the chatbot to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner.
- **Context-Based Responses**: The chatbot not only identifies objects but also provides contextually relevant information, enhancing the user experience.
- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing the integration of additional features and enhancements.

## Technologies Used

- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: A state-of-the-art model for image recognition tasks, providing robust and accurate object detection.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Leveraging advanced NLP techniques for understanding and generating human-like responses.
- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the chatbot.
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow**: Deep learning frameworks utilized for model training and inference.
- **Transformers Library**: Used for implementing both the Vision Transformer and NLP models.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChessMan08/advanced-image-recognition-chatbot.git
   cd advanced-image-recognition-chatbot
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up any additional configurations as necessary (e.g., API keys, environment variables).**

## Usage

1. **Start the chatbot:**
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the chatbot by providing images and asking questions. The bot will analyze the image, identify objects, and provide relevant responses.**

## Example

Upload an image of a car, and ask, "What make and model is this car?"

The chatbot will respond with the detected make and model based on the image analysis, e.g., "This is a Tesla Model 3."
